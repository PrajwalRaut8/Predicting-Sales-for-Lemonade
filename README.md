This program helps predict how much profit can be made at a lemonade stand each day based on lemon sales and costs, using a special dataset I made
# Lemonade Stand Sales Predictor with PyTorch

![Lemonade Stand](lemonade_stand.jpg)

Welcome to the Lemonade Stand Sales Predictor project! In this hands-on tutorial, you will learn how to build a neural network from scratch using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning library developed by Meta's AI group. Our goal is to train the network to predict the number of lemonades likely to be sold on any given day at a lemonade stand.

## Introduction

Running a lemonade stand can be influenced by various factors such as weather, pricing, and special promotions. With the power of artificial intelligence, we can create a model that predicts daily sales based on these factors. This project will guide you through the entire process.

## Getting Started

### Step 1 - Setup our Environment

We start by setting up our environment, importing essential libraries including PyTorch, and checking the PyTorch version. Make sure you have PyTorch installed, and if not, you can get it from [PyTorch.org](https://pytorch.org/).

### Step 2 - Download and Prepare our Dataset

We'll work with a synthetic dataset that simulates lemonade stand sales data. It includes information like the day of the week, weather conditions, pricing, and the number of lemonades sold. We'll download and preprocess this dataset to make it suitable for training our neural network.

### Step 3 - Build your Neural Network

Here, we create a simple neural network architecture using PyTorch. This network will take input features like the day of the week, weather, and pricing to predict the number of lemonades sold. You'll learn about the architecture and activation functions used.

### Step 4 - Train your Neural Network

This is where the magic happens. We train our neural network using the dataset we prepared earlier. We measure our network's performance and adjust its weights to make accurate predictions. You'll dive into loss functions, optimizers, and the training process.

### Step 5 - Analyze the Network's Performance

After training, we evaluate how well our neural network performs by visualizing the predicted sales against the actual sales. A successful model will result in a plot of dots closely aligned with a straight line.

### Step 6 - Test with Your Own Predictions

Now that our model is trained, you can use it to make predictions with your own input values. We'll show you how to pass new data through the network and interpret the predictions.

## Conclusion

This project is just the beginning of your journey into the world of neural networks and predictive modeling. You can explore more advanced concepts such as dataset splitting, real-world datasets, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance your model's accuracy.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this project to make it your own, and happy predicting!
